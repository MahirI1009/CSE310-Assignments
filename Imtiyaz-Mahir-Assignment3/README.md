In order to run the program `analysis_pcap_arp.py` you must have python and the library dpkt installed. To install dpkt, in your terminal do `pip install dpkt`. Then navigate to the directory that contains the program and run it in the terminal using `python analysis_pcap_arp.py <filename>.pcap`. You will need a valid pcap file, the file must contain at least one ARP request and one ARP reply, the ARP reply packet must come after the request, otherwise the program will not produce anything of value or may crash. If the pcap file is not within the same directory as the python file, then be sure to use the correct path to the pcap file in the command.  

An example: `python analysis_pcap_arp.py assignment4_my_arp.pcap`

This python program takes a pcap file with an ARP request and an ARP reply. It feeds it into a dpkt.pcap.Reader object which allows for iterating through the packets of the file, in our case we only have 2 packets. The loop skips non ARP packets, and it first adds an ARP request packet to a list of packets and only then if the loop arrives at an ARP reply, it will then add the reply to the list as well. After this the necessary information needed to be outputted will be outputted for both packets using bytes as indices in the packets. These bytes as indices will be used to print the Hardware and Protocol Size and Type, Opcode, and Sender and Target MAC and IP addresses.
